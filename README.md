Abalone Age Prediction
Overview
This repository contains an analysis for predicting the age of abalones using easily measurable physical attributes, thus replacing the traditional, labor-intensive microscopic counting of shell rings.

Models Used
Lasso Regression: Offers interpretability through effective feature selection.

Principal Components Regression (PCR): Balances dimensionality reduction and prediction accuracy, fine-tuned to optimize performance.

Data
The dataset includes attributes like diameter, height, and various weight measurements (whole, shucked, viscera, and shell).
